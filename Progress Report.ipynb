    "Once I had got to grips with Spotify API and made a dataset of songs with audio features, the next step was to check the quality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did this through the usual steps of checking for null values (none found), looking at the descriptive statistics of the dataframe's features, and creating a target (in this case the decade of the song's release, made by munging the release date).\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon checking the value_counts of the different decades, I found that there was less data the further back we go, and only 62 rows for the 1950's. Although I could address the class imbalance through resampling, I would prefer to simply scrape more data from artists of that era.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the dataframe contained no null values, 2 artists (Foreigner and Heart) from the Billboard Top 100 were missing, presumably because their names are common words that weren't uniquely identifiable for the Spotify search function.  Both are from the 70's, but with only two missing I decided the dataset would not be compromised significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-referencing the descriptive statistics with what I knew about the features from the Spotify docs threw up other issues. The 'loudness' feature, for instance, is represented with 'digital full scale', meaning a negative system where 0dB represents a signal's maximum representable value. Any louder than this and a track produces a form of distortion known as clipping, which is never permitted in professional production. However, Eminem's 'So Bad' came out at 0.496dB loudness; as a professionally produced track and an extreme outlier, I decided this was likely a Spotify analysis error and discounted it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then looked at the correlation heatmap to see which features a model could be built on, and which pitfalls to avoid. I found a measure of multicollinearity between valence, energy and danceability, which is understandable given that Spotify calculates them on similar criteria, but which will necessitate some regularization. The reasonable linear correlation between loudness and decade_start means a linear regression model, rather than a classifier, might actually be possible. A scatterplot of loudness (with means of each decade marked) showed that, while the spread of different loudnesses greatly increases with time, the means become closer to zero, proving the effect of mastering on music.\n",
    "\n",
    "A boxplot of the feature distributions shed light on the outliers in each feature: duration sits around the 3-5min mark with a few longer epics as upper outliers; with loudness, the hard cutoff at 0dB means the outliers are below; most songs' instrumentalness is close to zero (because of the recent prevalence of synthesized/electronic music), so any mainly instrumental songs are usually outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final graph was a line plot of every scaled feature's mean by decade, to try and spot obvious trends. In particular, I found that songs have become longer, louder, less acoustic and less valent in recent times. The first three make sense intuitively, but the last (that songs were happier in the 50's) was less obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final issue I have addressed is that of duplication, which was always going to be a problem given how many versions of each popular song are released. By regex extracting song titles before a hyphen (a reliable indicator of a '- live version' or '- remaster' in Spotify), I could take the earliest version of each song-artist duplicate to get the original recording/mix. While I will use the originals alone for my final model, I will also try to compare those to the live versions and remasters to see if any trends are visible. Remastering, after all, often involves dynamic range compression and boosting of older recordings to bring them up to modern production standards, which should surface as an increase in loudness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My blockers currently are:\n",
    "- The potential for sampling bias (e.g. when specifically looking for other artists from the 1950's). If the need for a larger sample causes me to try out many genres of early music while only focusing on pop in later years, I may find a difference in spread that never really existed.\n",
    "- Frequency analysis: I am aiming to include some measure of 'bassiness' in my final model, which I believe has increased over the years, but Spotify has no frequency-specific features (only ones they have generated). The 'timbre' measure found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-analysis/) would be helpful in that respect, if not for the lack of documentation on what exactly its coefficients represent. I have raised a GitHub issue with the dev team to see if I can get clarification on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next steps:\n",
    "- Come up with an unbiased sampling method for getting a wider scope of artists to fill in the gaps in the dataframe (once done, this will simply be a matter of plugging them into the function I made).\n",
    "- Running more detailed models with the filled-in and cleaned dataset.\n",
    "- Having one final go at signal processing with scipy (at the moment it is proving harder than I had hoped).\n",
    "- Finding a method of comparing originals with remasters."
